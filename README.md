# A naive boilerplate for `Amazon Rekognition` service

I wrote this small chunks of code from [AWS Rekognition dg](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/rekognition-dg.pdf) (developers guide) for faster development of a vision based product. Yeah... I went through the whole DG :/ 

## Installation

Use [pip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/setup-aws-cli.html) and configure your machine to use AWS services. You may follow [this guide](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration). [OpenCV](opencv.org) is optional but `recognize_face.py` is dependent on this. A personal note, if you need to detect or recognize faces [dlib](dlib.net) is always a better choice.

## Usage

Just execute the scripts one after another. I have written this code at a very early stage as a developer but if you need clarification you can raise issues. I will follow up ASAP.

## Contributing
Do whatever with this repo... I'll be following the pull requests and issues time to time.
